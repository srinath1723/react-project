# React- Day -9: useRef & useReducer


 ## Contents:
 
-[ ] useRef, useReducer

useRef:

- useRef returns a mutable ref object whose current property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.

- useRef is like a "box" that can hold a mutable value in its current property.

- Changes made to current do not cause a re-render.

# React- Day -6: Router
-[x] react-router-dom

 - Traditional web applications render new pages by making a request to the server for a new page. The server then responds with the new page, and the browser loads it.

 - Single Page Applications (SPAS) work differently. They load a single HTML page and dynamically update that page as the user interacts with the app.
 
 - React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It enables the navigation among views of various components in a React Application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps UI in sync with the URL.
  
 * React Router solves these problems by providing a `BrowserRouter component`, which uses the HTML5 history API to keep your UI in sync with the URL.
  
 * Install the router using `npm install react-router-dom`.
